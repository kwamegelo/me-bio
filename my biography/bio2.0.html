            <p class="about">I am pursuing computer engineering because I am passionate about solving complex problems through technology. From a young age, 
                I have been fascinated by how computers work and how they can be programmed to create innovative solutions. 
                 Computer engineering allows me to blend my interest in hardware and software, giving me the tools to develop efficient, 
                cutting-edge systems that can make a real impact. Whether it's designing circuits, optimizing algorithms, or working on 
                embedded systems, I am driven by the challenge of building smarter and more efficient technologies. My goal is to contribute 
                to advancements in computing that improve everyday life and push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible.
